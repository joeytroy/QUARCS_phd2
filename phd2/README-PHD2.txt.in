Welcome to PHD2 Version @VERSION@

PHD2 is guiding software inspired by the original PHD Guiding
application from Stark Labs. PHD2 is both free of cost and open
source, and development is community-driven.

PHD2's built-in help file is an excellent way to get started using the
program, regardless of whether you've had previous experience with the
original PHD.

or for bug reports, feature requests, and questions about PHD2
development, please join the Open PHD Guiding forum
